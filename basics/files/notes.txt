- map all rotors normally like typical tricopter 
- map servos 1 and 2 to pitch stick so that the same pitch stick controls both pitching motion (by changing rotor speed) and motion in x direction (by moving motors)
- map servos 1 and 3 to a separate knob for positive y motion 
- map servos 2 and 3 to a separate knob for negative y motion
- include null mixer for any skipped/unused outputs

note: it may also be (although unlikely) that all three servos have to be mapped for y motion even though the setup above maps only two and leaves the third for yaw control by the autopilot.
On second thought, when the rotors are tilted sideways, there is less drag so the yawing moment may no longer be an issue.
